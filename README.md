Fabco_Demo_Products_Page

Hi Palak,

Here’s an example of what I was thinking for your Products page. I went with a darker theme to match your logo colours. Of course, this can be edited to accommodate anything that doesn't work for you.

The main Navbar at the moment has 1 active menu: Products

When you click on “Products” in the navbar a side menu appears on the left.

This side menu Lists the 12 Product Categories for Fabco Plastics.

Currently, the first menu item “Pipes & Fittings” is active.

When you click “Pipes & Fittings it will take you to a sub-page that lists the “Pipes & Fittings” Product List.

This page is laid out in an accordion drop-down menu style. Click on the arrow on the right and the menu opens up.
The only active dropdown menu is for “Pipes & Fittings”.

Click the arrow on the right to open it up and see all its content and images.

All text content can be copied and pasted.

Of course, there’s still a lot to do to refine this page. For example, the search button and newsletter button still need javascript code to make them
more interactive with verification notifications to guide the user. 

also, the Image carousel at the top of the Products page has one image for now. It could use three to four more. The partner image carousel at the bottom of the page near the footer is just an example.
I will need to get my hands on hi-rez images of the partner logos. At the moment the images are too small and blurry. Just an example for now.

In addition, there's more work left to be done to make it more responsive on smaller devices(Cell Phones etc.) so everything fits perfectly.  

I still need to address the majority of the deliverables you outlined. I will address them as soon as 
we confirm moving forward. 

Hopefully, this demo page gives you a good idea of what I can do.

Thanks,

Bobby Cameron
